# ü™ê KOI‚ÄìTESS Unified Exoplanet Dataset (Tabular)

## 1. Origin and Context

This dataset merges data from NASA‚Äôs Kepler (KOI) and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) missions.
It provides standardized tabular astrophysical parameters for machine learning models focused on physical feature-based exoplanet classification.

By combining historical Kepler data with modern TESS detections, it enables comparison and transfer learning across missions.
