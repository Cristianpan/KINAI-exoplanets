# ü™ê KOI Exoplanet Light Curves Dataset (Kepler Mission)

## 1. Origin and Context

This dataset originates from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, specifically the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) catalog.
It supports AI-based exoplanet detection and classification using normalized light curves from the Kepler Space Telescope.
We use this data to train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN1D) that combines tabular and time-series data.

Our neural architecture is based on the models proposed by:

- [Shallue & Vanderburg (2018): ‚ÄúIdentifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05044)
- [Dattilo et al. (2019): ‚ÄúIdentifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning II: Two New Super-Earths Uncovered by a Neural Network in K2 Data‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10507)

These works introduced the AstroNet and AstroNet-K2 architectures, which process light curves through two independent convolutional channels ("global" and "local" views) before combining them in shared dense layers. Our model follows this dual-view CNN design to identify transiting exoplanet candidates and reject false positives.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `search_id` | Internal identifier (KIC ID) for the stellar system | Text | KOI |
| `num_planet` | Planet number within the system | Integer | Derived |
| `disposition` | Candidate status: 1 = Confirmed, 0 = False positive, Candidate = 2 | Integeer | Exoplanet Archive Disposition |
| `ror` (`koi_ror`) | Planet-to-star radius ratio | Dimensionless | KOI |
| `stellar_mass` (`koi_smass`) | Stellar mass estimate | M‚òâ (solar masses) | KOI |
| `ss_gravity` (`koi_slogg`) | Stellar surface gravity | log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(cm/s¬≤) | KOI |
| `period` (`koi_period`) | Orbital period | Days | KOI |
| `duration` (`koi_duration`) | Transit duration | Hours | KOI |
| `transit_epoch` (`koi_time0bk`) | Transit reference epoch | BKJD (Barycentric Kepler Julian Date) | KOI |
| `global_view` | Normalized global light curve | JSON | Processed locally |
| `local_view` | Cropped light curve centered on transit | JSON | Processed locally |

## 3. Light Curve Representations (global_view and local_view)

Two normalized signal representations are provided:

- Global View: Full flux variation including stellar variability and potential transit dips.

- Local View: Window centered on the detected transit to highlight shape, depth, and symmetry.
